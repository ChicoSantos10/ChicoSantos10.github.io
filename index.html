            <p>My name is Francisco, and have been exploring the world of game development since 2016. So far most
                of my experience is in Unity, but I'm currently learning Unreal Engine 5 as well. As for programming
                languages I'm very experienced with C# and C++
                since those are my daily tools but also have experience with plenty of other languages and am quite
                confident in learning and adapting to any language.
                Most of my time spent in Unity has been exploring the engine and learning its ins and outs, and I'm
                very confident in working in any part of the engine.
            </p>
            <p>Love working on anything challenging and always trying to find solutions that not only work but also
                are performant and efficient to any problem.</p>

                    <p>
                        Started learning Unity following their tutorials. In this time I also took the time to start learning
                        C# and started taking courses in both Unity and C#. Also starting learning more programming general
                        concepts like memory, algorithms... and started also learning C.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With this new knowledge started making my own prototype games to really consolidate everything and
                        also learn new things.

                        This was the last project for my graduation and is a 3D puzzle game in Unity. In this project
                        I was responsible for modifying the rendering system to allow for full screen effects,
                        creating tools to help productivity and flow as well as writing some gameplay code myself. I also
                        helped my coworkers implementing their own tasks and was responsible for making sure that the project
                        moved forward.

                        By taking advantage of Unity's scriptable render pipeline I created an outline shader that used depth,
                        normals and color differences to generate the outlines. This shader could be customized as well using the
                        editor to allow different color outlines as well as different sensibilities for each of the outline generating
                        variables. Another full pass shader created was a simple color remap that used a texture to blend the original
                        color with a new one (for this game we used a blue gradient, but it could be changed in the editor)

                    I also wrote other shaders for gameplay purposes like showing when the player introduced a wrong code,
                    or to give feedback to the player like when he clicked on a button it would highlight

                        I wrote tools to improve workflow between the members and to help speed up level creation.
                        For example, I created a tool that allowed to define the movement of the camera when the player
                        interacted with a certain object. This gave greater control but also an easy way to define how the
                        camera should behave under those conditions.

                    <p>
                        I participated heavily on the gameplay aspect as well. Implemented a ragdoll system for when the
                        player gets caught, wrote the movement code, level management, event management as well as input
                        management.

                        This game was developed as part of my graduation and is a 2D survival game in Unity. I was mostly
                        responsible for the AI systems and optimizations. Was also responsible for leading the project,
                        distributing tasks and suggesting implementation details.

                    <h2>AI</h2>
                    <p>
                        I was responsible for 3 main systems:
                    </p>
                    <h3>Enemy behavior</h3>
                    <p>
                        Created a behavior tree with a custom tool that allowed easy creation and debugging of enemy
                        behavior
                    </p>
                    <img src="images/Behavior-tree.png" alt="Image of the behavior tree custom tool">
                    <h3>Enemy pathfinding</h3>
                    <p>
                        Implemented an A* algorithm in conjunction with a map node generator.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Map generation</h3>
                    <p>
                        I implemented a map generator using a multistep process. First we define the center of each biome.
                        This allows for rule one to be kept: the spawn biome should be in the center and then the other should
                        form a circle around it. Then a version of a flood algorithm starting on each biome center fills
                        the map with the different biomes. By using some randomness here I guarantee that no biome would be
                        the same while also create some "holes" that do not allow the player to traverse. Then it cleans
                        the map by making sure that all nodes of a certain biome are connected. It then adds colliders so
                        that the player can only walk through the walkable biomes. It then creates the map texture by using
                        a compute shader using the biomes around a particular node to figure out what textures to blend.
                        To finish the map it uses a Poisson disc sampler to place assets and interactable objects.

                    <h2>Gameplay</h2>
                    <p>
                        For the gameplay I wrote several systems like a crafting and inventory management system where
                        equipabble items would show on the character. Aside from that I was responsible for creating
                        an input manager, an event manager, enemy spawners, combat and the save system
                    </p>

                    <h2>Optimization</h2>
                    <p>
                        For this game several optimizations were needed to ensure smooth gameplay. From spawners using a
                        pool of enemies to prevent constant instantiation and destruction of game objects, to pathfinding
                        needing the right data structures. Was the only one responsible for this task and the game runs
                        smoothly with no noticeable frame spikes.

                        Created a package to use for dialogue systems in games featuring a text animator and typewriter
                        effects. Highly customizable and reusable and full of ready to use effects while also being easy
                        for users to add more effects. Was used in the Project: Elevator game.

                    <h2>Text Animation</h2>
                    <p>
                        The user could write their text with tags which would be used by a text parser to delimit the animations
                        which would then run when the text played. Alternatively it could also instead be used to animate
                        the entire text

                    <p>
                        Another feature was a typewriter effect that could be used normally to display text gradually or
                        could be used together with effects like fade in, fade out, stretch or plenty of other effects.
                        There were other options like using input to skip the writing of text or moving to the next dialogue.

                    <p>
                        The package offered ways to save the created effects to be used either in different dialogues
                        within the same game or be saved in files to used in other games.
